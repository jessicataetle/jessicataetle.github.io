Right now, it is purely HTML and CSS, but I hope to add in some React.js and Redux.js components as I continue to to develop it!</p>

                    <p>Over two semesters, I worked on a team of 5 other students to plan
                         and implement a product for an assigned client. "Ask Docta: Telemedicine App" is the Android application
                         my team created for our client, which provides health care consultation access to Southern Cameroonian 
                         refugees living in Nigerian refugee camps. </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px">For this project, I was my group's project manager by managing and dividing up tasks in ZenHub. I also took the
                        lead on the front-end implementation of the Android application in React Native. </p>
                    <p>Here is a video of my group's elevator pitch and demo for this class:</p>

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px">For my Introduction to Computational Media class, I created a 3-Dimensional version of <a href="https://society6.com/product/piet-mondrian1622787_poster">this Piet Mondrian painting</a> using A-Frame. I chose to replicate a Piet Mondrian for this assignment because I grew up going to art museums with my mom, who is a fan of Piet Mondrian. I wanted to recreate the experience of going to an outdoor sculpture garden by enhancing the sculptural elements of this painting as well as adding rain and the gloomy backdrop to make the sculpture pop out of the screen.</p>

                    <p>For my Media Device Architecture class, the final project was to make a Game Boy Advance game in C. I chose to create Casanova, which is a game based on a bird "casanova" looking for love. Here is the video presentation of me playing the game and explaining it in more detail:</p>

                    <p>Another Game Boy Advance game that I coded in C was a basic snake game. Based off of the popular game Snake, the user plays as a snake trying to collect 10 apples in order to win the game. Here is a video demo I did explaining how to play the game:</p>
