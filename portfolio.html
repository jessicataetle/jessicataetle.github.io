                <p>For my Media Device Architecture class, the final project was to make a Game Boy Advance from scratch in C. I chose to create a game called Casanova, which is based on a bird "casanova" looking for love. Here is the video presentation of me playing the game and explaining it in more detail:</p>

                <p>I work in a science fiction lab at Georgia Tech, and part of the work we do is creating media for well known science fiction companies and awards. For DragonCon 2020, because it was virtual, we were tasked with creating a video presenting The Eugie Award, which is presented to an author who wrote the best piece of innovative fiction that year.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>I was tasked with creating a title card for the award using Adobe Photoshop, which is pictured below. I was inspired by the flowing nature of the Eugie Award logo as well as the borders featured in old film title cards. I also created author cards for each of the nominees for The Eugie Award that complimented the title card. Each author card centered visually more around the story and less around the author because the Eugie Award is less about the authors and more focussed on the story.</p>
