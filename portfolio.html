                    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px">For my Introduction to Computational Media class, I created a 3-Dimensional version of <a href="https://society6.com/product/piet-mondrian1622787_poster">this Piet Mondrian painting</a> using A-Frame. I chose to replicate a Piet Mondrian for this assignment because I grew up going to art museums with my mom, who is a fan of Piet Mondrian. I wanted to recreate the experience of going to an outdoor sculpture garden by enhancing the sculptural elements of this painting as well as adding rain and the gloomy backdrop to make the sculpture pop out of the screen.</p>

                    <p>For my Media Device Architecture class, the final project was to make a Game Boy Advance game in C. I chose to create Casanova, which is a game based on a bird "casanova" looking for love. Here is the video presentation of me playing the game and explaining it in more detail:</p>

                    <p>Another Game Boy Advance game that I coded in C was a basic snake game. Based off of the popular game Snake, the user plays as a snake trying to collect 10 apples in order to win the game. Here is a video demo I did explaining how to play the game:</p>

                    <p>Started by Stacey Abrams, Fair Fight promotes free and fair elections in Georgia and around the country by advocating for election reform at all levels, encourages voter participation in elections, and educate voters about elections and their voting rights. A new development in this organization is Fair Fight U, which is now a club at every major university on campus promoting voting to the student population. I have created a few instagram posts for this organization. All posts are in Georgia Tech's official color scheme, to indicate the information is intended for Georgia Tech students.</p>
                    <h3 class="portfolio-media-header">Key Dates for the 2020 General Election in Georgia:</h3>
                    <img src="../media/FFKeyDates.jpg" class='portfolio-media'/>
                    <p> For this post, I wanted to limit all the information about key dates to one picture, so that an Instagram user could easily repost it to their instagram story and educate their followers on key dates for the election. In terms of content, I organized the dates in bullets, and made the final bullet a different color than the rest to emphasize its importance. I wanted to include information about absentee ballots because it is important but isnt a date, so I included it in smaller text at the bottom. Finally, I added the yellow accent shape on the right to make it more visual appealing and more likely to get an Instagram user's attention.</p>

                    <p>For this post, I wanted the first picture to capture the user's eye and clearly state the purpose of the post because I knew all of the information about requesting an absentee ballot would not fit onto one picture. For the second, third, and fourth pictures in the post I wanted to include screenshots from the website official voting website to clearly walk a person through the process. Furthermore, I added key information for specfically requesting an absentee ballot to the Georgia Tech campus because I knew my audience for this post is located there.</p>

                    <p>I work in a science fiction lab at Georgia Tech, and part of the work we do is creating media for well known science fiction companies and awards. For DragonCon 2020, because it was virtual, we were tasked with creating a video presenting The Eugie Award, which is presented to an author who wrote the best piece of innovative fiction that year.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I was tasked with creating a title card for the award using Adobe Photoshop, which is pictured below. I was inspired by the flowing nature of the Eugie Award logo as well as the borders featured in old film title cards. I also created author cards for each of the nominees for The Eugie Award that complimented the title card. Each author card centered visually more around the story and less around the author because the Eugie Award is less about the authors and more focussed on the story.</p>
