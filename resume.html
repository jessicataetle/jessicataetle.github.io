            <p>Red Canary is an outcome-focused security operations partner for modern teams, deployed in minutes to reduce rick and improve security. During my time as an intern, I improved Red Canary's testing framework using RSpec so that flaky tests would fail less often, and regularly handled GitHub issues that were assigned to me including: making the Red Canary logo compatible with dark mode, removing the linkage between Red Canary accounts and depreciated salesforce data, and fixing the timing of provisioning emails to clients.</p>
